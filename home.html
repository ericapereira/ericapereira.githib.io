    <h1> Using Data Visualization to Address Social Challenges
    </h1>


    <p>Overview:
      In the United States there is systemic racism that is embedded in various government institutions. In a technological era like today we can now request and access data to embody various social injustices. In this project, I investigate the process to facilitate civic data access and visualization for social actors (social activist, community leaders, students, etc). I will create a tool that gives technical leverage to social actors. I will examine the current use of civic data by data scientist and journalist. I will then visualize public health data from Chicago, using various data visualization tools and document the process on the website. I hope the website is a tool that is used by social actors to learn the steps for data visualization and use the tool to interpret their own datasets for their social challenges.
